# Future Development

The project is designed for extensibility. Planned enhancements include:

- **Modularization**: Split `agent.py` into separate modules for each node (`input_node`, `processing_node`, `recommendation_node`) for better maintainability.

- **Database Integration**: Store metrics and recommendations in a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) for historical analysis.

- **Multi-Language Support**: Add support for recommendations in multiple languages (e.g., English, Persian).

- **Machine Learning**: Implement dynamic thresholds for recommendations using machine learning models (e.g., `scikit-learn`).
